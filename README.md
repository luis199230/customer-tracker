Background
----------

This was a test project for a prospective employer. The test was:

"Using AngularJS please create a single page web application that allows a user to Create, List, Update and Delete customers.  A customer is made of up the following attributes: Name, Email, Telephone, Address (Street, City, State, Zip). The web application should use .json files as the storage mechanism for each customer record."

I completed the task in about 6 days including learning AngularJS, Twitter Bootstrap, and the org.json Java library for the first time. It is meant primarily as sample code for future prospective employers.
